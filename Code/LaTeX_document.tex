\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright
That is, I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know, I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean a yes
But it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever.

\section{Methods}
In this paper we relied on Equation \ref{eq:newton}:

\begin{equation}
F = G \times \frac{m_1 \times m_2}{d^2}
\label{eq:newton}
\end{equation}

The equation has then been changed to Equation 2:

\begin{equation}
F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} G \times \frac{\sqrt{m_1 \times \sqrt{m_2}}}{d^{\sqrt[3]{2}}}}
\end{equation}

All of this according to what we said in section \ref{sec:intro}.

The final output of the analysis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:temporal}.

    \label{fig:temporal}
\end{figure}

Then, we found a linear trend (Figure \ref{fig:trend}).
